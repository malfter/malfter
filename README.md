### Hi, I'm Markus ðŸ‘‹

I mostly use GitHub just to get notifications from subscribed projects. My personal projects are hosted in a private [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) instance and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/malfter). In my free time I try to support projects from [kamapu.net](https://kamapu.net).

You can find my website (or better said my link collection ðŸ˜Š) [here](https://alfter-web.de/).

My preferred operating system is Linux/Debian, and I am also a friend of open-source software #floss. If you want to contact me you can find me on [Mastodon](https://chaos.social/@markusalfter).
