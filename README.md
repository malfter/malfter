### Hi, I'm Markus ðŸ‘‹

I mostly use GitHub just to get notifications from subscribed projects. My personal projects are hosted in a private [Gitea](https://gitea.io) instance and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/malfter).

You can find my website (or better said my link collection ðŸ˜Š) [here](https://alfter-web.de/).
